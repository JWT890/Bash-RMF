**Assessment Methodology**

1. **Information Gathering:**
   - Conduct interviews with key stakeholders
   - Review relavent documentation (e.g., policies, procedures, network diagram).
   - Perform vulnerabilities scans using appropriate tools
2. **Vulnerability Identification:**
   - Analyze scan results to identify potential vulnerabilites.
   - Manually test for vulnerabilities not identified by scans
3. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Assign severity ratings to vulnerabilites based on impact and likelihood of exploration
   - Prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation
4. **Remediation Recommendations:**
   - Develop recommendations for addressing vulnerabilites, including: 
     - Patching
     - Configuration changes
     - Security Awareness training
5. **Reporting:**
   - Prepare final report that documents assessment findings and recommendations.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Compliance:** Ensure that the assessment aligns with applicable regulations and standards
- **Change Management:** Implement a change management process to track and approve assessment activities.
- **Communication:** Communicate assessment findings and recommendations to relevant stakeholders in a timely manner

**Appendix:**
